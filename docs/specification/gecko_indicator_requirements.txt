The Gecko Indicator — Requirements Specification Document1. OverviewPurpose:The Gecko Indicator is a multi-timeframe trading system designed to automatically detect and visually highlight “Gecko” setups — consolidation and breakout-hook patterns that form within a strong higher-timeframe trend.Core Concept:When a strong EMA trend is present on the High Frame (HF), the indicator seeks consolidation and breakout-hook formations (the Gecko) two timeframes lower — Low Frame (LF) with dynamic support in the Mid Frame (MF)2. Multi-Timeframe StructureExample (LF=5m): HF=60m, MF=15m, LF=5mAvailable Frame Sets: 1m ? 5m ? 15m ? 60m ? 240m ? 1D ? 1W ? 1M.Selection Logic: The user selects the LF; MF and HF are automatically derived (e.g., LF=5m ? MF=15m ? HF=60m).3. Trend Detection (High Frame)Objective: Identify a strong directional trend that has persisted for ≥ 30 bars.Conditions:1. Price has trended consistently in one direction for ≥ 30 bars.2. The EMAs are in Correct Order of Moving Averages (COMA): 8>21>50 for uptrend, 8<21<50 for downtrend.3. Optionally display a Trend Label on the chart once a trend qualifies.4. Optional “Trend Age” counter showing number of bars in COMA alignment.4. Gecko Pattern Detection (Low Frame)Trigger Condition: HF Trend confirmed ? Begin scanning LF.Momentum Move (MM): Strong impulsive leg (≥ 1.5?ATR(14)). Must match HF trend.Consolidation: 20–100 bars of sideways movement. Horizontal Base with ≥3 swing touches.Test Bar (TB): Single large bar (>1.5?ATR) closing beyond base, ideally with rejection wick.Hook (FTB): Forms when price breaks back through TB’s high/low (failed breakout).5. Higher-Timeframe Support ValidationMF: Touch of 21 EMA.HF: Touch of 5 EMA.Failure to meet these conditions invalidates the setup.6. Entry, Stop, and Target RulesEntry: On re-break of the Base in direction of HF trend (≥0.2?ATR confirmation).Stop: 1 tick below/above FTB swing.Target: 100% extension of prior Momentum Move. Minimum RR = 2:1.7. Additional Pattern FiltersAt least one Stop-Run Level within pattern.Optional: Minimum ATR threshold on Test Bar.Optional: Reject patterns forming near major swing highs/lows.8. Alerts & LabelsAlerts:1. HF Trend Confirmed2. Potential Gecko Consolidation3. Test Bar Formed4. Hook Triggered5. Entry Confirmed9. Inputs and ParametersLow Frame (default: chart timeframe)EMA lengths: 8, 21, 50ATR length: 14HF Trend bars required: 30Consolidation range: 20–100 barsStop offset: 1 tickEntry buffer: 0.2?ATRShow visuals: trueEnable alerts: true10. Output DataExpose arrays for:- Trend direction/duration- Detected Gecko timestamps- Entry, Stop, Target prices- Reward-to-Risk ratios- Hook/Test Bar data (bar index, ATR multiple, wick ratio)11. Performance and UsabilityLow computation load across timeframes.Visual clarity and minimal clutter.Optional dashboard showing live Gecko setups across multiple frame sets.12.
